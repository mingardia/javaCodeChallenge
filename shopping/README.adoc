== Shipping Card Challenge

Welcome to the shopping cart challenge.  This model is a pretty straight forward shipping experience back end system
simulation.  The model is pretty straight forward.  There are products, customers, orders, payments, and a cart.  As
you might expect products are added to the cart and then submitted to a checkout service that is ment to "check"
the customer out.  Checking the customer out should go through the cart and using payment information utilize a
payment gateway service to process a payment and then update the customer's order history.

Here is a mostly correct diagram of the model.  As with most enterprises the documentation lags the code so the diagram
is not 100% accurate but a decent depiction

Some things to note about the architecture:

- Every model object has an id field which is assumed to be unique.
- The database is represented as a "Stub" class currently that basically manages a bunch of hash maps.  The id
  is used as a key into these hashmaps
- The architecture uses spring-boot, you can execute the server using mvn spring-boot:run at the root of the project
- The architecture exposes rest end points which are standard jax-rs annotated classes
- The rest end points are configured to be under /api/v1/{yourControllerPath}/{yourMethodPath}


There is a sample end point you can test to see if your envirionment is set upright.  Run the application
 by running mvn spring-boot:run at the root.  Then use post map or another tool to hit the url
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sampleCustomer/example


This should return

 [source,json]
 ----
{
  "id": "11111",
  "name": "Sample Name",
  "orderHistory": null
}
 ----

Besides that here is the general layout of the maven project.  In general it should be what you expect from
a maven project.


The file lay out:

[tree,file="directoryLayout"]
--
 src
    |-- main
        |-- java
           `-- com
               `-- enspirecommerce
                   `-- javaCodeChallenge
                       |-- config
                       |-- controller
                       |-- model
                       `-- service
--


Config contains the main springboot configuration to enable finding controllers and utilizes cxf.  Controller
contains the jax-rs controllers, model contains the model classes and service contains the services.
JavaChallengeApp1 contains the main spring boot main class.

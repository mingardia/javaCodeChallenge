== Shipping Card Challenge

Welcome to the shopping cart challenge.  This model is a pretty straight forward shipping experience back end system
simulation.  The model is pretty straight forward.  There are products, customers, orders, payments, and a cart.  As
you might expect products are added to the cart and then submitted to a checkout service that is ment to "check"
the customer out.  Checking the customer out should go through the cart and using payment information utilize a
payment gateway service to process a payment and then update the customer's order history.

Here is a mostly correct diagram of the model.  As with most enterprises the documentation lags the code so the diagram
is not 100% accurate but a decent depiction

Some things to note about the architecture:

- Every model object has an id field which is assumed to be unique.
- The database is represented as a "Stub" class currently that basically manages a bunch of hash maps.  The id
  is used as a key into these hashmaps
- The architecture uses spring-boot, you can execute the server using mvn spring-boot:run at the root of the project
- The architecture exposes rest end points which are standard jax-rs annotated classes
- The rest end points are configured to be under /api/v1/{yourControllerPath}/{yourMethodPath}


There is a sample end point you can test to see if your envirionment is set upright.  Run the application
 by running mvn spring-boot:run at the root.  Then use post map or another tool to hit the url
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/sampleCustomer/example


This should return

[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "11111",
  "name": "Sample Name",
  "orderHistory": null
}
----

Besides that here is the general layout of the maven project.  In general it should be what you expect from
a maven project.


The file lay out:

[tree,file="directoryLayout"]
--
 src
    |-- main
        |-- java
           `-- com
               `-- enspirecommerce
                   `-- javaCodeChallenge
                       |-- config
                       |-- controller
                       |-- model
                       `-- service
--


Config contains the main springboot configuration to enable finding controllers and utilizes cxf.  Controller
contains the jax-rs controllers, model contains the model classes and service contains the services.
JavaChallengeApp1 contains the main spring boot main class.

== Challenges

1. Finish out a full create, read, update, and delete scenario for customer.  This would mean adding more
   rest end points to the existing controller and interacting with the service and dataStoreStub classes.

2. Refactor the model classes and abstract away the common element into a base class ( the id ).  Leverage
   the common base class in the implementation of the dataStoreStub such that it can generically handle any
   future class that derives from the newly created base class.

3. Add the ability to unit test your rest endpoint.  This will mean you have to perhaps add new dependencies
   to the project, and write out some unit tests to interact with the rest end points.

4. Finish out the implementation of the checkoutService to actually update the customer correctly and create
   a new order.

5. Refactor the payment gateway service so that new implementations of the class can be added at a later time.

6. Add the ability to return XML not just JSON from your rest end points.

7. Provide a design of how you would introduce the notion of allowing the same infrastructure to handle multiple
   websites at the same time, including that some of those sites may be utilizing different currencies.
